# SwiftUI NASA APOD Viewer

## Overview
Welcome to the SwiftUI NASA APOD Viewer! This project demonstrates how to make API calls in Swift and SwiftUI by fetching data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. The app fetches an image and its details from the NASA API and displays it in a clean, SwiftUI-powered interface.

## Features
- **API Integration:** Learn how to make API calls in Swift.
- **Data Handling:** Receive and decode JSON data into SwiftUI models.
- **Dynamic UI:** Display real-time data from the NASA API in a SwiftUI view.
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Aimed at beginners who want to learn the basics of API integration and SwiftUI development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 12 or later
- Basic understanding of Swift and SwiftUI

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SwiftUI-NASA-APOD.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd SwiftUI-NASA-APOD
   open SwiftUI-NASA-APOD.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

### Usage
- When the app is launched, it fetches and displays the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day along with its title, description, and date.

### Code Structure
- `Model`: Contains the DataModel struct that mirrors the JSON data from the NASA API.
